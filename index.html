                        <li>
                            every page has a "root" tag called <code>html</code>, with two <strong>direct children</strong>, <code>head</code> and <code>body</code>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            inside body, you'll see a <strong>semantic enclosing tag</strong> <code>main</code>. This contains almost everything.
                        </li>

                        <li>within <code>main</code> is another semantic tag, <code>article</code>, with children <code>header</code>, <code>section</code>, and <code>footer</code> </li>
                        <li>each of these has its own children</li>

                    </ul>
                    We're going to do some wrting and perhaps use some new tags. See the instructions/guidelines that start just before the table...

                    <p id="start">Habermas says that </p>
                    <blockquote>At one time, the process of making things public [<i>Publizit&auml;t</i>] was intended to subject persons or affairs to public reason, and to make political decisions subject to appeal before the court of public opinion. But often enough today the process of making public simply serves the arcane policies of special intersts; in the form of "publicity" it wins public prestige for people or affairs, thus making them worth of acclamation in a climate of non-public opnion. </blockquote>
                    <p>If you believe this narrative -- in which the public sphere has suffered a marked decline since the early 19<sup>th</sup> Century &mdash; the open question is, can the Web reverse that trend? Everything depends on what you think the main virtues of the public sphere are, and how the Web can prop them up.</p>

                    <p> When <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> first tried to build a web browser, he thought it would be a kind of specialized word processor. he imagined that every user would be <i>creating</i> as much as <i>consuming</i>. He wanted to call it the "read/write web". But browsers never became the creation tools he wanted them to be. Instead we now have <a href="http://facebook.com">websites</a> that invite creation. These present their own encodings of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walled_garden_%28technology%29">public</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/privacy">private</a>.

                    <p> Think about the structure of HTML (links, hypertext) and also about the interactivity that the Web now gives you. Make an argument IN HTML, in <code>section.yourwork</code> about whether the Web saves the Public Sphere (<a href="http://www.humanities.uci.edu/mposter/writings/democ.html">Mark Poster thinks it does</a>) or continues to pose problems for it. As you do this, <strong>use as many tags as you can, and mess with the CSS on this page if you have a chance</strong>. In particular, </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>add src attributes for the images</li>
                        <li>add some content to the table</li>
                        <li></li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>Does the Web save the Public Sphere?: My Response</h2>
                        <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sphere">Public Sphere</a> is a space in which individuals come together to discuss public issues in society, and originated in the 18th century with the rise of newspapers and journals as a new type of media, as well as salons and coffeehouses, which offered a new way of socialising. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Habermas">JÃ¼rgen Habermas</a>, a German philosopher, claims that with the rise of new media in the 20th century such as radio, television, and film, the idea of the public sphere is lost because the way we consume and interact with media has changed, and the communication of ideas has began to dissolve.</p>
                        <p>Personally, I agree with Mark Poster, and believe that the Web is saving the Public Sphere. In my opinion, media that rose to prominence in the 20th century was very exclusive. Although it was eventually accessible by everyone, not everyone was able to put forward their opinion, and I think that this is still the case today, in which only people with influence and power are able to have their opinions heard by others. However, with the rise of the web and social media in the 21st century, I think that the Public Sphere is saved. Due to the accessibility of the web by most people, we are able to have intellectual conversations and debate over issues in a virtual reality; the web has become what was the coffeehouse in the 18th century. </p>

                        <p>Social media and blogging platforms like Twitter and Tumblr have allowed us to speak our opinion, and have our voices be listened to from people all over the world. Social media has brought news, such as the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2015/09/16/social-media-key-to-hong-kongs-occupy-central-fight-for-democracy.html">Hong Kong Umbrella Revolution</a>, to people at an instant, instead of several days to reach across the world through traditional media. Ultimately, although the way in which we communicate with each other has changed over the last three centuries, the Public Sphere is brought back to life because most people are communicating with each other freely once again, and discussing issues that face our society today.</p>
